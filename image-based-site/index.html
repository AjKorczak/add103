    <p>One thing about me is that I am a huge art person, and love creating art of a wide range of things.
        Anything I can really get my hands on and do I will try, I mainly stick to Digital
        artwork, but I have been leaning more towards painting and traditional artwork, as 
        the year continues. All photos you see were taken by my best friend.
