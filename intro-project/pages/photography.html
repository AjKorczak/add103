    <p>Photography has been a recent hobby that I have picked up. but it has been something
        that I have always been interested in. Most of the time, the photos that I have been 
        taking are either for class using a canon camera or has been on my phone because I found
        the current moment enjoyable enough to take a photo. The materials I use to create
        my photos are listed below and provided by MCC.
