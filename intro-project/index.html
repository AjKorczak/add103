    <p>This year is my first year at MCC. 
            One of my biggest passions is photography. I love
            capturing moments and turning them into art. I enjoy finding beauty in everyday life. I often carry my camera with me,
            ready to snap a photo whenever inspiration strikes. Photography allows me to express my
            thoughts and feelings.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy creating digital art. With the help of graphic design
            software, I can blend colors, shapes, and images to bring my ideas to life.
            I love experimenting with different styles, whether 
            it's designing colorful posters or creating illustrations for fun. I often find myself lost in the creative
            process for hours.</p>
        <p>As I work toward my goal of becoming a graphic designer after college, these hobbies play a
            crucial role in making sure not only do I not burn out, as well as, helping me build my skills 
            and develop my artistic voice. I am excited to learn more about graphic design at MCC and hope to use my photography and digital
            art to create amazing projects.</p>
